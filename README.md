# Automatic-Water-Level-Controller-
The Automatic Water Level Controller is a PLC-based system designed to maintain the water level in a tank. The system uses water level sensors to control a pump, ensuring the water level remains within the desired range. This project aims to prevent overflow and dry running of the pump, thereby improving operational efficiency and conserving water.
